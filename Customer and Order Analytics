#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? Remember to filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs like we did in the "dealing with messy data" section of the previous lesson!
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT MIN(price), product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT location, quantity, product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct c.acctnum) AS total_customers, 
avg(quantity*price) AS avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON f.orderid=c.order_id
WHERE f.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product
